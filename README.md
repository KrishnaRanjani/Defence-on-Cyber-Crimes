####  Analysis Tools
  * `Open Source Software Cyber Security Tools` : Security at data and network level is greatly enhanced by these software tools which open the door to a more safe and secure cyber world.
  * `Security Information and Event Management` : A SIEM system provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.
  * `AI primarily based Sandbox`: With AI and machine learning we can  do inference and pattern-based monitoring and alerting, but the real  opportunity is the predictive restoration.
  * `Sandbox` : used to detect malware offers an additional layer of protection against security threats, such as stealthy attacks and exploits that use zero-day vulnerabilities.

## AI and Machine Learning can boost Cyber Defences  
 * The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning  is being used to transform cyber security and aid security analysts identity threats more accurately.
